## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### 1. **Check User Role in Database**
```sql
SELECT username, role FROM users WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

### 2. **Check Browser Developer Tools**
- Open F12 → Network tab
- Look for security-related errors
- Check if templates are being cached

### 3. **Check Server Logs**
- Look for Spring Security authentication logs
- Check for role assignment messages

### 4. **Force Template Recompilation**
- Delete `target/classes/templates/` folder
- Restart application

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still seeing admin options as student
**Solution**: Clear browser cache + restart application

### Issue: "Create" buttons still visible
**Solution**: Check if `sec:authorize` directives are properly closed with `/>`

### Issue: Navigation not updating
**Solution**: Ensure all templates include the security namespace:
```html
xmlns:sec="http://www.thymeleaf.org/extras/spring-security"
```
